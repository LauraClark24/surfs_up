# Surfs Up

## Overview
Ice cream and surfing may be a great duo, but the only thing that makes them better is beautiful weather. In order to get a better understanding for how our surfing/ice cream shop will do, we will be analyzing the important third member of the trio, weather.

- The numbers for June and December are extremely similar. (This viewpoint may be slightly skewed as I am from Kansas, where we can get the entire range of temperatures from both months in one week.) The average from these two months are less than four degrees apart. The minimum has the most difference, a whole eight degrees. Every other statistic shifts by four degrees or less across the extremities of the year. This seems to bode well for our desired business.
- The standard deviation bodes well for our potential store as well. Less than a half of a degree shift in this descriptive statistic indicates that the winter and summer months will be equally predictable. 
- The largest difference, as stated above, is the minimum, which is most likely to be indicative of a day, or short stretch of days, where the store would not do as well as expected. 
## Summary
 The results are mostly positive for the outlook of our potential store. Similar averages and near identical standard deviations lead me to think this supports the viability of the desired business. Precipitation is also likely to affect the business, so it would be optimal to take that into account. A scatter plot with rain on one axis and temperature on the other would be the most efficient visualization and being able to compare one for June and another for December would be more indicative than comparing just the temperatures. Doing the same scatter plot, put for just one area at a time may also be useful in the preparation process, specifically in helping determine where is best to look to set up the potential shop. 
 
 
This analysis is based on my judgment, but I have no experience with surfing or being in Hawaii. Before taking my analysis as accurate, it is recommended you find someone with experience in this area to see if the mentioned points are valid.
